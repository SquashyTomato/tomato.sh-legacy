My Personal Website & Portfolio

Includes a basic Documentation System for Blog Posts and Articles supporting Markdown.

The aim is to make the site as modular as possible so if I update information I don't need to edit a load of code to implement it, nothing fancy.

No database or external setup is required, everything is maintained within the website files.

Feel free to use and modify this as you wish as long as you credit me for the original codebase, take snippets if you wish for your own projects!
